# If/ Else conditions are used to decide to do something based on something being true or false

x=10

# Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) - Used to compare values


# simple if
if x > y:
    print(f'{x} is greater than {y}')
elif x == y:
    print(f'{x} is equal than {y}')
else:
    print(f'{y} is greater than {x}')




# Logical operators (and, or, not) - Used to combine conditional statements

if x > 2 and x <= 10:
    print(f"{x} is great than 2 or less than to equal to 10")


# Membership Operators (in, not in) - Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object




# Identity Operators (is, is not) - Compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
